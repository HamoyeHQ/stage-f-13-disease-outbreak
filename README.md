# Disease Outbreak In Nigeria Dataset #
*Predicting Meningitis Disease Outbreak Using Machine Learning*

The data is autogenerated not empirical and is aqcuired by writing a PHP script with access permission to query a database. I created a data table with random 200 surnames, 25 first names and 20 middle names. Each first name and middle name had an initialized gender to help prevent a female name been assigned to a male, them afterwards I randomly assigned the age and the disease values based on the common disease outbreaks in Nigeria. T dataset includes about 39 columns and 280000 rows.
